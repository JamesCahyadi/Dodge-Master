#### How To Play
The objective is to collect yellow blocks while avoiding the red blocks, which randomly bounce around the window. The white bordered square in the center of the screen is the safe zone - an area where the red blocks cannot enter. You only have one life so getting touched by a red block will end your run. The number of yellow blocks collected will appear inside the safe zone. The higher the number, the better the score.

#### Controls
Move the blue box around using the arrow keys.
